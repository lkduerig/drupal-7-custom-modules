The tieto.com Megamenu

Drupal 7 module which created a megamenu. On the landing page, it is larger, and expands upwards to cover the height of the header carousel. On other pages, it expands down. All dimensions, column numbers, positioning, etc were calculated dynamically, to allow for changes in content.
