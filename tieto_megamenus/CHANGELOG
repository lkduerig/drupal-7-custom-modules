-------

Some major bug fixes as to related to menu settings not getting saved. There were two issues,

   a.) the setting "Enable megamenu" did not work on the menu edit page because the checkbox was
       being used on the e.g. /menu/manage/menu-india, it gets triggered only on /menu/manage/menu-india/edit
   b.) The parent menu of a menu block did not get saved on the block edit page, option "Menu" on e.g.
       /admin/structure/block/manage/menu_block/4/configure

Moved the "Enable megamenu" checkbox to the menu edit page. Also had to write a custom submit hook to get the
parent menu saved. This issue should be investigated further on the cause, perhaps updating menu_block module
will resolve the issue. The excess function is to be found in tieto_megamenus.module lines 271 - 283 and the
function is intiated at line 266 of the same module file.
